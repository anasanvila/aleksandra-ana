I am passionate about Web Design & Development and Project Management. Currently I am enrolled in Specialization studies (phD), <b> <a href='http://www.fon.bg.ac.rs/eng/studies/doctoral-studies/information-systems-and-quantitative-management/information-systems/#' target='_blank'>Information Systems and Management, School of Organizational Science, University of Belgrade</a></b>. My work history and my completed Master program in <b><a href='http://www.arh.bg.ac.rs/en/studies/master-studies/' target='_blank'>Architecture, University of Belgrade</a></b>, have provided me with a diverse set of design, technical and business skills. I have realised that the same fundamental design principles in architecture can apply to software engineering and to be immensely helpful when creating a good code.</p>

<p> My work experience is in <span style={{color:'#4b7097'}}>Javascript React development (using the latest React version and ES6), Three.js, UX/UI & Graphic design and Agile management</span>. I apply my visual creativity and original ideas to improve projects. I have been recognized for problem solving, decision making and leading abilities. I was praised for making creative landing page for sports application, for winnng in the Interventure Hackaton Competition (first as a part and then the leader of the team), as well as client satisfaction.
